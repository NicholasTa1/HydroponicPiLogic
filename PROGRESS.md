# Progress Log

Running log of work on this repo. Newest entries at the bottom. Every session updates this file
as part of its commit, not as an afterthought — it's the fastest way to reconstruct project state
without re-reading the whole diff history.

## 2026-09-20
- Added `PI_CONTROL_SPEC.md`: handoff spec for the Pi-side control subsystem (sensing, dosing,
  safety, local storage, Supabase sync, BLE). Full rationale lives in that file.
- Added `pi/` skeleton: config, sensor interfaces (master-basin EC/pH/water-level; per-basin
  temperature/water-temp/humidity/CO2/light), SQLite 5-minute buffer, sync stub, fan
  hysteresis feedback loop (on >72F, off <58F), and the orchestration loop in `main.py`.
- All sensor `read()` methods are stubs (`NotImplementedError`) — no hardware wired up yet.
- Note: this skeleton clears the local SQLite buffer every 5 minutes after a successful sync,
  which differs from the full-crop-cycle retention originally described in
  `PI_CONTROL_SPEC.md` section 7. Flagged, not yet reconciled.
- Basin count is a placeholder (`BASIN_IDS = ["basin_1"]` in `pi/config.py`) — update once the
  real basin count is known.
- Next: wire real drivers into the sensor stubs, starting with EZO-EC/pH over I2C.

## 2026-09-27
- Wired the first end-to-end pipeline: dummy pH reading -> local SQLite buffer -> remote
  Supabase table, confirmed working with real inserts landing in the project.
- `PHSensor.read()` now returns dummy data (`random.uniform(5.5, 6.5)`) instead of raising
  `NotImplementedError`, standing in for the real EZO-pH I2C read until that hardware is on
  the bench. Other sensors (EC, water level, per-basin env sensors) are still stubs.
- `sync.py` now does a real Supabase insert via `supabase-py`, using credentials from a local
  `.env` (never committed — see `pi/.env.example`, and `.gitignore` at repo root).
- Discovered the Supabase project already had a `sensor_readings` table (from earlier/other
  work), with a *wide* schema (`id, humidity, temperature_c, light_intensity, ec, ph,
  recorded_at`) and no `basin_id` column — different from the long/narrow format our local
  SQLite `readings` table uses. Went with the existing table rather than creating a
  duplicate; `sync.py`'s `_row_to_record` only maps the `ph` column for now and raises on any
  other sensor. `pi/supabase_schema.sql` documents this rather than creating a table.
  Open item: this wide table has no room for multiple basins — will need a `basin_id` column
  or a schema rethink once more than one basin/sensor needs to sync. Not decided unilaterally
  since the app/CV side may already depend on the current shape.
- Row Level Security on `sensor_readings` initially blocked inserts from the publishable key
  (expected/correct behavior). Resolved by granting the key insert access from the Supabase
  side rather than switching to the service_role key.
- Added `pi/test_ph_sync.py`: manual one-shot smoke test for this pipeline (read -> insert ->
  sync -> clear) without waiting on the 30s/5min loop in `main.py`.
- Added `.gitignore` (repo root) and `pi/.env.example` so Supabase credentials and the local
  `hydro.db` file never get committed.
